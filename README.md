## About Me
Hi, I'm Ivan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in systems that are hard to reason about â€” where architecture meets logic, and failure is subtle.

Most of my work lives in the gray zones between math, software, and trust: systems that behave differently under pressure, protocols with hidden assumptions, and designs that are one edge case away from breaking.

I explore architecture and security of smart contracts, Layer 2 systems, AMMs, vaults, and bridges â€” especially where economic logic and code execution intersect.

In the long term, I aim to audit blockchain systems across all major languages and dive deeper into ZK.
